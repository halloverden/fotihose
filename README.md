# Fotihose

The general idea behind Fotihose is to create a network of standalone Angular components that lets you install that one component instead of a whole library.

## Dogma
- Do not encapsulate native HTML elements
- Use sane styling defaults
  - Make them configurable!
- Have as few dependencies as possible
  - No dependencies on external packages
- Make it as easy as possible for the developer to include and use the packages
  - Minimum needed config
  - Again, with a mix of sane defaults and configurable styles and functionality

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
